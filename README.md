# 🌌 Interactive Particle Cloud

A responsive, interactive particle animation built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. This project creates a mesmerizing display of moving particles that react to mouse movement, change shape, and shift color over time. Users can control particle properties like number, size, speed, and interaction radius through an on-screen UI.
